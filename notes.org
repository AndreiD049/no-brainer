Everything i usually use in org-mode
*** Resources
Useful resources:
- [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text!]]
*** Initial comfortable setup
I find this initial setup quite comfortable to use.
Add below to y......fig =init.el= file:
            ... ...  ..
#+begin_src..macs   ..
(defun orgmo.e-se up ()
  (progn
    (org-indent-mode)
    (auto-fill-mode)
    (set-fill-column 78)
    (message "Org-mode set up ;)"))
  )
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'orgmode-setup)
#+end_src
*** Enable indentation mode
To enable indentation mode (looks a bit better), add this to your
~init.el~ file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun orgmode-setup ()
(progn (org-indent-mode)))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'orgmode-setup)
#+end_src

*** Fast insertion of code blocks (and any other templates)

In order to faster insert code blocks in org mode, use either:
1. =C-c C-,= and select a template to insert
2. Enable =org-tempo= by adding below line to your =init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-tempo)
#+end_src

Then, you can insert a code block by just typing =<s <TAB>=

*** Formatting
- /italic/
- *bold*
- _underscore_
- =verbatim=
- ~code~
- +strikethrough+

*** Tables
Any line starting with =|= symbol is interpreted as a table.  For
example wtite =|Name|Surname|Age + <TAB>= and you will start a table
**** TODO Useful shortcuts
*** Add file to org-agenda edited
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 1ed495c7-4875-4d98-88c7-511718c4850e
:END:

Use function =org-agenda-file-to-front=, or shortcut =C-c [=.  This
will add/move the file to the front of variable list
=org-agenda-files= If you add a directory, it will add all the files
from this directory.

*** Searching in org-mode
You can use your agenca (=C-c a=) as a search engine.

A good resource on this search -
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html]]

1. Make sure all your files/directories are added visible to agenda
   (see [[id:1ed495c7-4875-4d98-88c7-511718c4850e][Add file to org-agenda]])
2. Enter agenda search view with =C-c a s=
3. Here you can search either simple strings - =ex: mystring=, or
   search multiple keywords (=+type +class= will search for entries
   containing both words =type= and =class=).

*NOTE:* If search doesn't start with a character like =+, -, \*= it
will be interpreted as a literal string search

*NOTE:* If you use minus sign instead of plus, you will exclude a
word, so =+type -class= will search for all entries containing =type=
and not contianing =class= You can also search on regulas expressions,
example =+{type\|class}= will search entries containing =type= or
=class= keywords (notice the escaped /pipe/ character)

Notes on emacs itse
*** Disable annoying backup files

**** Specify another directory

For more info, see [[info:emacs#Backup][manual]] To stop emacs from making backup files in
the same directory, you can add following to your =init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Backup to another directory
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.backups")))
 #+end_src

You can then create a directory as specified and all backup files will
go in there.

**** Disable backups

To disable making backup files at all, set below variable:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq make-backup-files -1)
#+end_src
*** Drawing ascii diagrams

*** Workflow. In this order:
When working on a feature, i will usually follow below steps:

1. Make it work
2. Make it fast
3. Make it pretty
4. Make it clean (refactor)

*** Create ssh key in windows and add it to github
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e1d81e89-b499-42a8-a2d2-368d0a23e8d5
:END:
1. Create an Ssh key with Powershell ~ssh-keygen -c andrei.dimitrascu@gmail.com~
2. run in ~Powershell Get-Content -Path $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | Set-Clipboard~
   to save your public key to the clipboard
3. Go to https://github.com/settings/ssh/new and add the content of your public key file
4. Restart all terminal sessions, if =HOME= Environmental variable is set
   correctly Git should start working with the new Ssh key (it will look for
   =%HOME%/.ssh/id_rsa= file)

*** Create link in powershell
There are 2 types of files in windows, soft and hard.
- =Soft links=: just like regular links, there is an arrow symbol next to the icon.
- =Hard links=: Make it appear like the file is really on the location,
  although it's a link.

#+begin_src powershell
# Create soft link
# Path can be either a file or a folder

> New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "PathWhereLinkShouldBeCreated" -Target "Target"

# Create hard link for a file

> New-Item -ItemType HardLink -Path "PathWhereLinkShouldBeCreated" -Target "Target"

# Create hard link for a folder (junction point)
 
> New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "PathWhereLinkShouldBeCreated" -Target "Target"

** T-SQL
*** 3VL or Ternary logic
Ternary logic in T-SQL represents predicates which may have 3 values:

1. TRUE
2. FALSE
3. UNKNOWN

*UNKNOWN value happens when one of the operands is NULL*

Rules of ternary logic:

Any comparison of 2 =UNKNOWNs= is also =UNKNWON=
Comparison of any =KNOWN= value to =UNKNOWN= value is also =UNKNOWN=
A State predicate (a strict Yes or No question), always evaluates to =TRUE= or =FALSE=
*** Aggregate functions
Aggregate functions are the ones that take multiple values, and return a single value. Examples of aggregate functions:

1. MAX
2. MIN
3. AVG
4. COUNT
